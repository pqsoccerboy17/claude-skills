            Triage this newly opened issue:

            1. Classify as one of: bug, feature, question, documentation
            2. Assess priority: critical, high, medium, or low
            3. Add the appropriate labels (type and priority)
            4. If relevant, identify which skill category (ai-apis, data-analysis,
               dev-tools, document-processing, productivity, research) the issue
               relates to and add that as a label too.

            Read the issue title and body carefully. Cross-reference with the
            repo structure and CLAUDE.md to understand context. Add a brief
            comment explaining your classification reasoning.

            Keep your response concise - this is a lightweight triage, not a
            full investigation.
