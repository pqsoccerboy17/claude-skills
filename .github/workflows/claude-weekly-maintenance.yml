            Perform a weekly maintenance check on this repository:

            1. Security: Run pip audit (install pip-audit first) to check for
               known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
            2. Tests: Run pytest tests/ and report any failures.
            3. TODOs: Scan all files for TODO, FIXME, HACK, and XXX comments.
               List each with file path and line number.
            4. Outdated patterns: Check for any patterns that contradict
               conventions in CLAUDE.md (e.g., shell scripts that should be
               Python, missing SKILL.md files in skill folders).
            5. Structure: Verify each skill folder has a SKILL.md with required
               frontmatter (name, description).

            Create a GitHub issue titled "Weekly Maintenance Report - [date]"
            summarizing all findings. Use sections with headers. If everything
            looks clean, still create the issue confirming a healthy state.
